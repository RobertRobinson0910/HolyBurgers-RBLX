            <h1>How it began</h1>
            <p>It all started in 2023, in a Roblox game with the name of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Obby Creator</span>, made by <span style="font-weight: bold;">mario118118.</span> I've started this game as a joke (we were originally known as a maccies), V1 was poorly built but had some very good features, like a flooding system and the ability to steal the safe which was in the small kitchen. We reached the amount of over 100 likes. This HB era will never be forgotten. </p>
            <h1>Version 2</h1>
            <p>After 6 months, we decided to remaster HB by making a new version (always in Obby Creator). We made a better fast food building and redesigned the HB logo. This era introduced the <span style="font-weight: bold;">HB Kiosk</span> system, a restaurant POS made by Rob inside of Obby Creator.</p>
            <h1>Last version in Obby Creator</h1>
            <p>V3 arrives after a year, it has been the shortest version of HB. This version introduced lighting and remastered systems. It was the biggest HB fast food and got the highest amount of staff members.</p>
            <h1>Moving to Roblox Studio</h1>
            <p>As Obby Creator is limited, we have moved to Roblox Studio to make a game with tons of new features. We've decided to rebrand our supermarket game (Freemart), to make it a fast food to continue the development of HB. This version is currently being built with the amount of 5 developers. We are almost in beta, you can be updated about HB's development progress in our community.</p>
